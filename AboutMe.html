<h2>About Me</h2>

<img id="mypic" src="assets/images/mypic.jpg"
        
<p>	Hello and welcome to my webpage. My name is Marame Gattan. I am an Emergency doctor who is very passionate about her job. One reason why is because I love to care for everybody and I love the untraditional working hours and versatality in my practice. I love how its interprofession and work as a team with a common goal of providing excellent healthcare. I thrive on taking care of the critically ill patients and the geriatric patients.</p>

<p>I am also a part of the Durham VA simulation faculty, which is the modern way to teach medical decision making and tasks. It puts the learner at the focus of the training to provide excellent care and skills. I thrive on the 'aha' moments that consistently happen during my training. This is the best gift you can give a medical educator. Also, it's a way to find system issues prior to system failure.</p>

<p>That's the technical stuff, but I am a family person and my family comes first in everything. I am the outgoing person in my family which means I drag everybody to connect with friends. I love to try new things and visit new places and be outdoors but away from spiders and snakes. I am very exciteable, and can never sit still and be in total tranquility. Rarely will I sit down and stay down. </p>
